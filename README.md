1. I used Cypress to automate the demoblaze website for my git repository. In this, I execute some test cases(positive and negative)on all modules one by one using POM(The main file to run all individual test cases MainFile.cy.js).
2. I used Fixtures for login test cases (The main file to run all individual test cases is MainFile.cy.js ).
3. Also, I automate and run the whole flow in which I perform one positive test case on all modules(For this you have to run AllFlow_Main_File.cy.js).

// The reason I mention these two files' names is that I merged all individual modules' test cases on a single file and for the whole flow I created another file

//In future I also add more test cases and try to structure my code in a good way.
